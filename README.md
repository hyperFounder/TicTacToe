# TicTacToe Application

Players take turns placing their Mark, X or O, on an open square in the grid. The first player to make 3 of their own mark in a 
row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game. If all 9 squares are filled and neither player has 3 in a row, the game 
is considered a Tie.
